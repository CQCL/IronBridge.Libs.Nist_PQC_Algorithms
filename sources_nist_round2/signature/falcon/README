This archive contains the following files and directories:

Reference_Implementation/
    falcon512/
        Reference implementation of Falcon with recommended
        parameters "N=512,q=12289", using NIST API (api.h).

    falcon768/
        Reference implementation of Falcon with recommended
        parameters "N=768,q=18433", using NIST API (api.h).

    falcon1024/
        Reference implementation of Falcon with recommended
        parameters "N=1024,q=12289", using NIST API (api.h).

Optimized_Implementation/
    falcon512/
        Optimized implementation of Falcon with recommended
        parameters "N=512,q=12289", using NIST API (api.h).

    falcon768/
        Optimized implementation of Falcon with recommended
        parameters "N=768,q=18433", using NIST API (api.h).

    falcon1024/
        Optimized implementation of Falcon with recommended
        parameters "N=1024,q=12289", using NIST API (api.h).

KAT/
    generator/
        NIST-provided code to generate KAT files. To use them, copy
        the files from one of the reference/optimized implementations
        described above into a temporary directory, along with the
        three files from this directory, then compile all the C files
        together. The resulting executable will generate a '.req' and
        a '.rsp' file, that should match the KAT files below.

    falcon512-KAT.req
    falcon512-KAT.rsp
        KAT vectors for Falcon-512 (N = 512, q = 12289)

    falcon768-KAT.req
    falcon768-KAT.rsp
        KAT vectors for Falcon-768 (N = 768, q = 18433)

    falcon1024-KAT.req
    falcon1024-KAT.rsp
        KAT vectors for Falcon-1024 (N = 1024, q = 12289)

Supporting_Documentation/
    2A_cover_sheet.pdf
        Cover sheet for submission.
    falcon.pdf
        Detailed specification of Falcon.
    Statements/
        Statements of intellectual property by submitters.

Extra/
    c/
        Reference implementation, basic tests and command-line tool.
        This code offers an API meant for easy integration in
        applications.


Notes
=====

The "reference" and "optimized" implementations are identical to each
other. They are also the same code as the implementation provided in the
"Extra/c/" directory, except that they implement the NIST API (derived
from eBATS) but lack the command-line tools and support Makefile; also,
code for obtaining random seeds from the operating system is removed
from these implementations.

These implementations use "ANSI C", by which we mean that they conform
to the 1989 version of the C standard, with the addition of the following
features that have been included in the 1999 version of the C standard:

 - standard header <stdint.h> with the exact-width types int16_t, int32_t,
   uint32_t, int64_t and uint64_t;

 - 'inline' function qualifier;

 - 'restrict' type qualifier.

The implementation in "Extra/c/" has its own Makefile; it compiles into
two command-line tools, "test_falcon" and "falcon". "test_falcon" runs
some self-tests. "falcon" is a tool that can generate and encode key
pairs, compute signatures on files, and verify such signatures.
